Things I would change or add:
1. Another database table that would save all the data from each time the script was ran

2. Add dates to the portfilo. There are transactions happening. Adding dates would allow for a slightly more complex SQL query that would give more percise data back when running the script. Example if I have 5000 Microsoft stocks I bought and kept for x days and then sold 1000 of them. If I queried for the dates when I still had 5000. I would have different data then dates after I sold the 1000.

3. Maybe add a few more print statements so a user could see what is going on in the console.

4. When ever someone submits a date that the stocks were closed it will still create a csv. So to make it so makes a csv only when we have full information I would create a virable called cache as a dict. And each stock we went through that had full information I would save it into that dict to then be ran into the CSV. IF nothing was in the dict. We don't run the CSV
